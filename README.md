# Email-Spammer
This is a small program which sends messages to single/multiple users.  
How to use the program is intuitive.  
It has 4 options:  
* Send a email to a few people.  
* Sending an email to multiple people using list entry format.  
* Spamming a particular email address with N mails.  
* Spamming multiple email addresses with N mails each, using list entry format.    
This unfortunately only works on the Gmail interface.  
All you need to do is run the code and follow the steps.  
Also this program does not support HTML entries yet. (Working on that update)  
Note:- This program is strictly educational and the author cannot be held responsible for any illegal activities in which the script is used.
